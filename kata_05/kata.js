// DNA Matching

// Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus
// of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and 
// functioning of living organisms.

// Task:
// In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other,
// as are "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the 
// DNA and you need to return the other complementary side. A DNA strand 
// is never empty or there is no DNA at all.

function myFunction(dnaString) {
  // example input => output 
  // "ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
  // "GTAT" --> "CATA"
  return dnaString;
}
